A Tech Lead, Development Manager, and burrito aficionado 🌯 with broad technology experience

I'm into a wide range of subjects, covering both software and real-world problems - including things like:
 - general purpose recommendation systems, with an emphasis on eComm
 - distributed computing on top of traditional web infrastructure
 - interactive generative media (ex using GANs and language models)
 - small to medium sized business logistics, vendor and warehouse management
